    "### Power Supply Unit (PSU)\n",
    "Each lab station is equipped with an Agilent E3631A power supply, located on the bottom shelf. You can think of this device as a controllable battery that allows you to specify its voltage and current outputs (more on voltage and current later). \n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a brief summary of the steps you should take each time you use the power supply. This is just a reference; you will get to use the Power Supply shortly:\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <strong>Set a current limit:</strong>\n",
    "This device allows you to limit the amount of current it outputs, which is very useful to prevent accidentally destroying parts when a circuit is connected incorrectly. The current is shown on the right of the display. To set a current limit, first push the \"Display Limit\" button. Next, push the \"Current/Voltage\" button on the right of the machine so that the current is selected (blinking). Then, use the arrow buttons on the right to select the digit you want to adjust, and then use the knob to adjust the value of that digit. Generally, we will use $0.100A$ unless otherwise noted. Do this for all output voltages. **<span style=\"color:red\">$0.100A$ might seem like a small amount, however, this is still enough to cause serious damage to the circuit components and microcontroller.</span>**\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <strong>Select an output:</strong>\n",
    "This device is capable of outputting 3 different voltages with maximum values of $6V, 25V$, and $-25V$ respectively. Make sure to push the button for the output you would like to use.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <strong>Turn the output on:</strong>\n",
    "By default, the output of the device is turned off. For the device to actually output current, press the \"Output On/Off\" button. <strong> Always turn the output OFF whenever you are idle / don't need the Power Supply!</strong>\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <strong>Set the voltage:</strong>\n",
    "After selecting the correct output (step 2), set the voltage to the desired value. To do this, push the \"Current/Voltage\" button so that the Voltage (displayed on the left) is selected (blinking). Then adjust the value just using the arrow buttons and knob in the same manner as setting the current limit. <strong>Make sure you are adjusting voltage and NOT current.</strong>\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",

    "### Oscilloscope\n",
    "The oscilloscope is another useful piece of test equipment that can be used to measure signals that change over time. Unlike a voltmeter, which only shows the instantaneous voltage value, the oscilloscope shows a graph of a voltage versus time. This is particularly useful for measuring how devices like sensors respond to inputs. Although this instrument may appear complicated, half of the knobs are just to adjust the axes of the voltage plot. \n",

    "Below is a brief overview of how to use this oscilloscope when testing a hypothetical circuit:\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "$1.$ <strong>Obtain a Probe:</strong>\n",
    "Grab an oscilloscope probe from the back wall. They are gray and have two connectors at one of the ends: The gray connector is a spring loaded clip (pull back to expose clip), and the other connector is a black alligator clip. Your probe might be missing the gray shell on the spring loaded clip, but that's okay.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "$2.$ <strong>Test the Probe!:</strong>\n",
    "Turn the oscilloscope on (button in bottom left corner). Connect the probe to one of the 4 input channels. Make sure that the channel is on (indicated by a green light on the channel number). To turn a channel on, simply press the corresponding numbered button. To turn it off, push the button twice. To test the probe, first locate the 3 metal testing tabs to the left of the 1st input channel (pictured below). Connect the black alligator clip of the probe to the middle (horizontal) tab. Connect the spring loaded clip end (or just the probe tip if your probe lacks a shell) to the leftmost tab (vertical). With the probe connected, hit the auto-scale button in the the top right (pictured below). If your output is a square wave (pictured below), then your probe is working. If your output is not a square wave, tell your GSI immediately and get a new probe.\n",

    "<img src=\"http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/images/lab0/oscope_test.jpg\" align=\"center\" style=\"height:200px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$3.$ <strong>Connect your probe to your circuit.</strong>\n",
    "Again, this is a hypothetical circuit.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$4.$ <strong>Auto-scale:</strong>\n",
    "Potentially skip steps 5-7 by using the Auto-scale button (see image above) to automatically scale the axes. **Don't get too dependent on the Auto-scale button; sometimes it doesn't do a good \"enough\" job.**\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$5.$ <strong>Adjust the horizontal axis of the plot.</strong>\n",
    "The large knob at the top left controls the horizontal time axis and allows you to zoom in or out. The time increments represented by the tick marks on the plot are indicated at the top of the screen.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$6.$ <strong>Adjust the vertical scale.</strong>\n",
    "The larger of the two knobs for each channel allows the vertical scale of the voltage graph to be adjusted. As with the horizontal scale, the number of volts per tick mark on the graph is marked at the top of the screen.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$7.$ <strong>Adjust the offset.</strong>\n",
    "In some cases, signals will appear off screen; adjusting the smaller of the two knobs corresponding to each input will shift signals up or down on the plot.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$8.$ <strong>Add measurements such as average voltage, amplitude, etc.</strong>\n",
    "Measurements can be added by pushing the \"Meas\" button and using the buttons at the bottom of the screen to select and add measurements.\n",
    "<br>\n",

That being said, if you lose anything or something breaks, we can supply you with replacement parts, however, you will have to pay for the replacement parts. **If you plan on taking EECS 16B in the future, remember to hold onto your Launchpad (microcontroller) as you will not get a new one in 16B.**"

    "Welcome to the first lab in the imaging module! The goal of this module is to build the imaging system introduced in class. The physical components of this system include a pico projector, ambient light sensor, some passive electronics, and a [TI MSP430 Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpad.html?DCMP=rtos&HQS=ep-sdo-rtos-pr-lp-launchpad-en) microcontroller. The completed setup of the imaging system is shown below in figure 1. \n",

    "### System Overview\n",
    "Figure 2 is a high-level block model of our imaging system. Here is the system flow: 1) The ambient light sensor converts light energy into electric current; more ambient light leads to more electric current. 2) The current produced by the ambient light sensor then travels through passive electrical components, which translates the current into a detectable signal (a voltage signal). 3) The TI Launchpad reads this signal, and after some linear algebra the voltage signal gets converted into an image. 4) Further improvements are made via software to increase the quality of the image.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital images are composed of a grid of [pixels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel), each of which represents a single color. To create a digital representation, optical imaging systems measure the energy, equivalent to light in this case, reflected off of objects to determine the values of these pixels. Because different colors reflect different amounts of light, measurements of reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between colors.\n",

    "Commercial cameras, such as those found in smartphones, use chips called CMOS image sensors to measure millions of pixel values at a time (think of this as millions of devices akin to the ambient light sensor that all fit on an approximately 30mm$^2$ chip). In contrast, our system can only measure one light intensity value at a time, so we will instead use a controlled energy source, the projector, to illuminate specific regions of the image one region at a time. We then use the ambient light sensor to record the energy that reflects off of each region.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The ambient light sensor converts light to induce a flow of electrons, and the circuit then outputs a voltage corresponding to light intensity. The specific configuration of the circuit sets the ambient light sensor up so it is most sensitive to changes in light. \n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This changing voltage is now a set of real numbers and much closer to something we can use to represent our image on a computer. We use a microcontroller (Launchpad) to take samples of the signal and convert it to a set of numbers we can then use in IPython.\n",

Don't feel intimidated if you don't know what these things are. ** At this point in the course, you are NOT expected to know what these components are or what their function is. ** You will eventually master these components during the circuits part of 16A.

    "A voltage is defined as a difference in electric potential between two points. For example, the voltage source we will be using in this lab has a potential difference of $+3.3V$ between the positive and negative terminals of the source. Because a voltage requires two points to define, it is often convenient to define a common point in a circuit as a reference. This reference voltage, commonly referred to as \"ground\" is defined by convention to be $0V$, and therefore allows us to conveniently describe voltages at any point in the circuit with respect to 0.  \n",

To do this, press one of the four black pushbutton labeled \"RST\" found on the front side of the MSP. Unplugging and replugging the MSP has the same effect.\n",
