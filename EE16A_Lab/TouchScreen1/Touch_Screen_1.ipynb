    "Welcome to the first lab of the touchscreen module. In this module you will build 2 different touchscreen systems introduced in lecture. But before we can play around with the touchscreens, first we have to learn some hardware fundamentals. In today's lab we will be working with perhaps the simplest circuit that does work - an LED circuit. We will also give the circuit fading capabilities both using a physical component and using an Launchpad.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lab, we will build a resistive touchscreen with a 3x3 grid, and in the third lab we will build a single-touch capacitive touchscreen that employs a Capacitance Sharing sensing system. Lastly, in the final week we will explore a method to improve the quality of the output of our screens."

    "LEDs are elements that emit light when the voltage drop between its two terminals is above a certain value. When emitting light, the LED acts as a resistor with its resistance depending on the amount of current forced through it. Its brightness also depends on the current flowing through the terminals. An important characteristic of an LED is that it is a polarized device, so its two terminals are not identical. The triangular side of the LED symbol and the longer leg of the component is the positive (Anode) terminal of the device, while the flat side of the symbol and the shorter leg of the component corresponds to the negative (Cathode) terminal. In the PCB, the polarity is written as A and C respectively. \n",

    "The brightness of an LED is directly related to amount of current going through it; more current leads to higher brightness. To power an LED we apply a positive voltage between the Anode and Cathode terminals; this is called forward-biasing of a diode."

    "In order to build our circuit, we first need to learn an important skill called soldering. [Soldering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering) is a process in which two or more metal elements are joined together by melting and flowing solder into an electrical junction, or joint. Soldering is useful because it enables us to establish an electrical connection between two circuit elements, which gives us the ability to build a complete circuit. \n",

    "<li>Place your desired circuit element into the PCB.

Bend the component lead 45 degrees to fix it in place.</li>\n",

    "<li>Touch the tip of your soldering iron to the metal ring and component leg at the same time. (See diagram below)</li>\n",
    "<li>Feed solder **into the joint** (not the soldering iron) while this is happening. It should only take a couple of seconds at most to fill the joint with a proper amount of solder.</li>\n",
