    "The resistive touch screen you built last week is well-suited for devices using a stylus because the screen has to be deformed in order to sense a touch. Resistive touch screens are also well suited for computer peripherals, such as keyboards, to sense button presses. However, a lot of devices don't require a stylus or a hard press; this is where capacitive touch screens save the day.\n",

    "Today, we will be implementing a capacitive touchscreen. We will build a capacitor at a junction and measure the capacitance at that point. When you touch the top copper plate, your finger adds additional capacitance between the bottom plate (ground) and your finger, resulting in two capacitors in parallel. We can measure this increase in capacitance quite easily; as we have learned, parallel capacitances add up. We can measure this change in capacitance at first with  a multimeter, then a charge sharing circuit."
